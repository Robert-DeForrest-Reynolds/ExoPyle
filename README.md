# Motivations

##### Why make another text editor?

I'll try to keep it simple. I like Neovim's motives, but dislike it's execution. I feel it falls victims to a lot of the problems C itself falls into in comparison to Zig. It's old, tried, true, and stable, but because of that is almost religious in it's values, and ways of implementation. VSCode is a joke, I genuinely think that it's bad, and it's a prime example that people will "just deal with it" for the sake of execution. I mean people deal with Visual Studio, and JetBrains IDE's in the same vein. I fully understand the importance of debuggers, and profiling your code, but I think that it doesn't need to be the bloated mess that the previous popular attempts turned out to be.

##### Why not run in the terminal?

Because Neovim exists. I don't intend to replace Neovim. I intend to replace VSCode. Server admins have good reason to use Neovim. I don't think the everyday program has a good reason to use VSCode, other than that's what people use when they want to stay lighterweight than a full-on IDE.

##### Why Zig?

I think Zig needed more projects to prove it's salt. I also recognize how fast it is, and want to myself see how it'll do with this implementation. I believe it'll at least be faster than VSCode, and the customizability will truly be comparable to Neovim. I want a package manager, and I want manual extension from someone who is new to the editor to be easy. The API I provide to interact, and build extentions will be a scripting language that Mimics Pineapple.

##### What's ExoPyle?

I don't quite know yet myself.
