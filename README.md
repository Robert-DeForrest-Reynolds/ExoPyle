### Design Philosophies
 - Very little batteries included.
 - Extensive API for Maximum Extensibility
 - Fast
 - Minimal UI Design, Minimal Focus Lost

### Extending
To extend, create a Python script within the `Packages` directory, within the directory that ExoFyle is located. If you downloaded an official release, it'll come with an empty package directory within the directory. There is also a `PackageExamples` directory with examples if interacting with the API.
